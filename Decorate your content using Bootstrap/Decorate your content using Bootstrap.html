      and the existence of curses—malevolent spirits born from negative human
      emotions. After consuming Sukuna’s finger to save his friends from a
      curse, Yuji becomes the vessel for Sukuna, a dangerous entity. He is taken

      the Tokyo Metropolitan Jujutsu Technical School. Throughout the season,
      Yuji and his classmates, <code>Megumi Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki,</code> face

      <h3>Season 2</h3>
      The second season delves deeper into the lore of jujutsu sorcery, focusing
      on the Shibuya Incident arc, a major storyline in the manga. It expands on
      character backstories, particularly highlighting the conflicts between
      sorcerers and curses. Yuji, alongside his friends, confronts escalating
      threats as Sukuna’s influence grows. The season showcases high-stakes
      battles, moral dilemmas, and the complexities of friendship and sacrifice,
      as characters navigate the consequences of their choices in a world filled
      with darkness. Both seasons blend action, horror, and supernatural
      elements with character development and emotional depth, making "Jujutsu
      Kaisen" a compelling watch.
